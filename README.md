# Capstone-3-national-park-website
Third capstone project at Tech Elevator coding bootcamp. 
A website using MVC principles to make a simple website containing information about national parks.

## Overview
Like the previous two projects, I had a partner who shall currently remain nameless.
It was the capstone to the third module, which focused on backend and MVC principles.
This was accomplished with C# Razor code in ASP.NET combined with HTML. It also features some CSS.
It also features a SQL database as with the previous project.

## How it works
This project represent the capstone of server-side programming, so everything happens on the backend.
It uses a standard MVC pattern with get and post methods to allow users to see information about the parks in our database,
as well as allowing the users to vote on their favorite park.

Additionally, the user may choose preferences which are stored in session information
and which alter the information presented on some pages.

## Future plans
As of 5 August 2019, of the three projects I have finished, this one feels the most complete.
I feel that a project of this type is best served with server-side MVC principles,
because very little interactivity is necessary for a site like this.

If I ever decide to make improvements, this verson will be preserved in a separate legacy branch
while new work continues in another branch.
